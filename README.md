# Cve-Search for Docker [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/version/ttimasdf/cve-search.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ttimasdf/cve-search "Dockerhub") [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/ttimasdf/cve-search.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/ttimasdf/cve-search "Inspect Layers")
- This is a docker container for the CVE-Search tool.
- Port 5000 is exposed for web interface.
- The `withdb` tag contains *pre-fetched database* which will save you **TONES** of time!
  - The initial import of database costs 3.1 hours on a 4th Gen Intel i7 workstation (which built this image).

## Usage
```sh
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name cve ttimasdf/cve-search:withdb
```
  - The database will be downloaded when the container is first launched, this can take some time.
  - You can then run, for example `docker exec -it [CONTAINER] search.py -f nagios -n` or other scripts provided by [cve-search](https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search) to interact with the database.
  - Use `docker exec -it [CONTAINER] cvedb -u` to update the database.
  - Most importantly, you can use **the WEB INTERFACE at port 5000** (or whatever you exposed)
