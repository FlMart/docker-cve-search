# Cve-Search for Docker [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/version/ttimasdf/cve-search:withdb.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ttimasdf/cve-search "Dockerhub") [![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/ttimasdf/cve-search:withdb.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/ttimasdf/cve-search "Inspect Layers")
- This is a docker container for the CVE-Search tool.
- Port 5000 is exposed for web interface.
- The initial import of database takes over 6 hours to get going on a reasonably specced machine
- This fork of the original repo is based on an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) image so supports Python 3.6 which is required for CVE Search nowadays

## Usage
```sh
sudo docker build -t cve-orca .
sudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name cve cve-orca
sudo docker exec -it cve /bin/bash
cd /opt/cve/
./sbin/db_mgmt_json.py -p
./sbin/db_mgmt_cpe_dictionary.py
./sbin/db_updater.py -c
./sbin/db_mgmt_ref.py
```
  - The database will be downloaded when the container is first launched, this can take some time.
  - You can then run, for example `docker exec -it [CONTAINER] search.py -f nagios -n` or other scripts provided by [cve-search](https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search) to interact with the database.
  - Use `docker exec -it [CONTAINER] cvedb -u` to update the database.
  - Most importantly, you can use **the WEB INTERFACE at port 5000** (or whatever you exposed)
