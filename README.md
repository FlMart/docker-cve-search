# Cve-Search-Docker
- This is a docker container for the CVE-Search tool.
- Port 27017 is exposed by default.

## Usage
```sh
CID=$(docker run -d --name cve ttimasdf/cve-search-docker)
docker attach --sig-proxy=false $CID
```
  - The database will be downloaded when the container is first launched, this can take some time.
  - You can then run ```docker exec -it [CONTAINER] bash``` to interact with the container.
  - Use ```./docker-entrypoint.sh``` to update the database.
  - Use ```./bin/search.py``` to search it.
